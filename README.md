# ARTCOMP_6-5-2018
Artistic Fractal Generation Program with Scripting Language

The purpose of this project was to develop a program that is can speedily create asthetically pleasing fractal art for an art competition.
Two fractals were entered and scored very high 58/60 and 60/60.
The file ARTCOMP_Manual.zip contains a pdf that will elaborate on history of the program, how the program works, and how to use the program.

Message to the Internet:
I hope you enjoy this program and that you can learn from and expand on this program and others like it.
The internet and the people who made it possible helped me learn how to program and further my interest in computers.
This is my first contribution back to eveyone whose authored books and posts from reddit, StackOverflow, Wikipedia, and other sites that have helped me get to where I am today.
From the hobbiest to the hackers to the multi-national corprate server administrator all of their questions they post and the answeres they posted to help others have helped me.
I want to give back to these people and having this project for the public domain is my way of giving back to them and others just starting to learn.
I also hope this project will help others learn, be inspired, and to give back.
Thank you!

# Guided Tour
1. Fractal_Examples 
	Directory contains fractals and their patterns generated from the scripts in Script_Examples.zip and rendered with artcomp.bin in Executables.zip.
2. Script_Examples.zip 
	Contains example scripts for others to build or exapand on when creating patterns for the fractals.
3. Executables.zip 
	Contains the source code artcomp.c, the Linux executable artcomp.bin, an example script file, and run.sh.
	run.sh is a demo bash script file already preset to render an almostgray.bmp fractal image.
	artcomp.c is written in ANSI-C99 standards and more information on how to compile is included in the source file.
4. ARTCOMP_MANUAL.zip
	Contains information about and how to use ARTCOMP in a pdf file.
	This file was compressed into a zip file due to speed issues with rendering the pdf on github.
5. LICENSE.txt
	Contains the legal information for the MIT License.
6. Responses
	Directory containing responces from the judges on two fractals that I entered into the VASE art competition. Names on these two documents have been censored for their protection.
