# ARTCOMP_6-5-2018
Artistic Fractal Generation Program with Scripting Language

The purpose of this project was to develop a program that can speedily create asthetically pleasing fractal art for the VASE art competition. Two fractals were entered and scored very high 58/60 and 60/60.
The file ARTCOMP_Manual.zip contains a pdf that will elaborate on the programs development history, operation, and functionality. The program was written in C (C99 Standard) and the code was designed to be cross platform.

# Message to the Internet
I hope you enjoy this program and that you can learn from and expand on this program and others like it.
The internet and the people who made it possible, helped me learn how to program and further my interest in computers.
This is my first contribution back to eveyone whose helped me get to where I am today (authored books and made posts on reddit, StackOverflow, Wikipedia, and other sites).
From the hobbiest to the hackers, to the multi-national corprate server administrators, all of the questions and answers you've posted to help others have helped me.
I want to give back to these people and having this project for the public domain is my way of giving back to them and others just starting to learn.
I also hope this project will inspire others to give back.
Thank you!

# Guided Tour
1. Fractal_Examples - Directory contains fractals and their patterns generated from the scripts in Script_Examples.zip and rendered with artcomp.bin in Executables.zip.
2. Script_Examples.zip - Contains example scripts for others to build or expand on when creating patterns for the fractals.
3. Executables.zip - Contains the source code artcomp.c, the Linux executable artcomp.bin, an example script file, and run.sh. run.sh is a demo bash script file already preset to render an almostgray.bmp fractal image. artcomp.c is written in ANSI-C99 standards and more information on how to compile is included in the source file.
4. ARTCOMP_MANUAL.zip - Contains information about and how to use ARTCOMP in a pdf file. This file was compressed into a zip file due to speed issues with rendering the pdf on github.
5. LICENSE.txt - Contains the legal information for the MIT License.
6. Responses - Directory containing responces from the judges on two fractals that I entered into the VASE art competition. Names on these two documents have been censored for their protection.
